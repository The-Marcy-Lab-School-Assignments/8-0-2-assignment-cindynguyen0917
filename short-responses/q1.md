# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
The dangers of making API requests with API keys from the frontend is that the keys will be exposed in the network tab that anyone using the deployed application can see. Making the API request from the server avoids this danger because cilents/users are not privy to innerworkings of the server unless the developer purposely allows those variables to be public.
